# Update From Maintainer | Project Archived
This project has been archived as it is no longer active (The event ended ages ago) and I am no longer able/willing to invest my time into it sufficently. I may re-activate it at a later date later this year as another social experiment though!

# Boom Bot
A test to see what happens if the internet is allowed to run rampant with a discord bot and it's code.

This will probably blow up (Go up in smoke) which is why it's called Boom Bot 

## Bot Info
This bot is making use of the discord.py v2 library.

This bot was created on the 27/8/22 and the trial will run from the 30/8/22 to the 1/10/22.

Want to see the bot in action? Join the Arty Studios discord server: https://discord.gg/5y9tDDBkBW

## Inviting the bot to your own discord server.
Courtesy of Drac in the Arty Studios Discord Server, I have been informed that there is a way to add discord bots to your own server. I am preparing a way to make this possible but if you ever plan on adding this bot to your own server please consider the following:

**I do not endorse or recommend you adding this bot to your own discord server. It will pose a safety and security risk to your server.**

_**If you choose to add this bot to your own discord server, it is at your own risk and no-one can be held responsible for what happens to your discord server after adding it (Boom Bot) to your discord server.**_

**If you want to see the bot in action please join the Arty Studios discord server or Boom event server (Coming Soon).**

## Thank You
Thank you for choosing to participate in this wild and crazy project. It is just a random idea to see how this bot will fair over the course of this one chosen month. I would like to thank the admins that have agreed to help out running this project.

Let's make this bot go boom!
