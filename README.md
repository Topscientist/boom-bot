# Boom Bot
A test to see what happens if the open-source community is allowed to run rampant with a discord bot and it's code.

## Inviting the bot to your own discord server.
Courtesy of Drac, I have been made aware that you can generate a bot invite or add code to generate a bot invite link on your own.

**I do not endorse or recommend you adding this bot to your own discord server. It will pose a safety and security risk to your server.**

_**If you choose to add this bot to your own discord server, it is at your own risk and no-one including Topscientist/Artymartin3459#9245 can be held responsible for what happens to your discord server after adding it (Boom Bot) to your discord server.**_
